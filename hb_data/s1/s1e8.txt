[The scene opens with Loona sitting in the back of a car. Her phone buzzes, and she looks down and sees Blitzo trying to call her. She declines the call.]
Driver: (offscreen) You want me to drop you off here?
Loona: *glances out the window* Oh! Uh! Yeah. Yeah, this looks right. I, uh haven't been here before.
[Loona steps out of the vehicle and music can be heard playing as the car drives off. She looks down at her phone and texts Vortex.]
Loona: (over text) Hey, I'm her
Loona: (over text) Oh shit
Loona: (over text) *here, sry :)
[Loona looks around nervously until Vortex calls out to her.]
Vortex: *waves hand* Loo-naaa!
Vortex: Hey girl! Glad you could make it!
Loona: Tex! Yeah, hey. Thanks for inviting me.
[The two walk into the mansion, where the party is taking place.]
Vortex: Course! Course! Hey, everyone! Meet the new face!
[Vortex howls in excitement, prompting everyone else to do the same.]
Vortex: You want a- drink or anything?
Loona: Oh, uh... *tail rises* sure! Yeah, totally...
[Loona drops her fake smile and looks over to a group of valley girl-esque Hellhounds.]
Vikki: And so, I told him "I'm not gonna go get it, unless you fucking throw it this time."
Dalmatian Hellhound: That is so, not fetch!
Vikki: Not fetch...
[Before Vikki could continue, Loona chimes in nervously.]
Loona: (nervously) Ha, ha, ha, yeah! Like, that happens all the time. Aha...aha...
Vikki: Oh-em-gee. Loona? Lunatic Luna? That you?
Loona: Uhhh, yeah. It's Loona... yeah.
Vikki: Wow. I can't believe you're showing up to another party. I mean, do you even remember the last one?
Loona: *grits teeth* I'm sure you'll remind me.
Vikki: *takes out phone* Yeah, this... *shows a picture of Loona vomiting* This you right?
[Loona growls in response.]
Loona: Why do you still have that?
Vikki: *looks over to the picture* It brings me joy. You know, you're supposed to keep things that bring you joy.
[Loona growls even more at her.]
Vikki: Wow... you're being really negative. Your aura is really aggressive right now.
Loona: Oh, yeah? Well maybe it's 'cus I'm in the presence of a massive bitch!
[The word "bitch" echoes throughout the party, making everyone else gasp in disapproval.]
Vikki: *feigns being offended* Oh... my dog... Wow!
Loona: What? Is that not an okay thing to say? Like, come on, it's true!
Demon: (offscreen) You can't say that.
[Loona's ears droop in response as Vortex comes back with drinks.]
Vortex: (confused) Did I miss anything?
[Loona notices and puts up her fake smile again.]
Loona: *takes drink* No, no, no... Haha... No, nothing... *clears throat* No.
[A voice offscreen booms through a microphone, attracting most of the partygoers.]
Unknown Demon: (offscreen) Haha! How're my dirty bitches doing toniiiiight?
[Vortex smiles at Loona in response, inviting her over.]
Unknown Demon: Awooh, awooh! Y'all ready to party with the Queen Bee of Glu-tto-ny? Come on!
[The demon reveals herself to be none other than Beelzebub, who was twirling around the disco ball as she hypes up her audience of partygoers.]
Beelzebub: Hell yeah! 'Cus the honey is flowin' tonight! And this bitch 'bout to get fuckin' wild! Let's get it started!
[Beelzebub grabs onto a pole. Cut to Loona looking around nervously as Beelzebub starts to sing her song.]
Beelzebub: ♫Cotton candy, cotton ca- candy♫
♫Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy♫
♫Hey! I'm whatchu need, I'm watchu want♫

♫Cotton candy (Ah-ah, ah-oh)♫
♫Cotton candy (Ah-ah, ah-ah)♫
♫I'm whatchu want, not watchu need (Ah-ah, ah-oh)♫
[A brief shot of a hellhound drinking while peering into one of Bee's honey pits then getting knocked over by a pillar of rising honey.]
♫Hey! I don't know why, I'm whatchu want, but it's the truth♫
♫I'm not your lie♫
♫Let them eat cake, let them eat pie♫
♫Or, better yet, let them eat cotton candy♫

♫Cotton candy (Yeah)♫
♫Cotton candy♫
♫I'm whatchu want, not watchu need♫
♫So, watchu want?♫
Beelzebub: Ya hungry; Take a bite!
[Bee enlarges the taco one of her guests planned on eating, then shoves it into his mouth.]
Beelzebub: Get fucked tonight! (♫So, watchu want?♫)
[Bee moves onto the next table, where she enlarges the alcoholic beverage of two dog demons which she then shoves down their throats.]
Beelzebub: Your Queen Bee brings the sweet stuff, so keep making me that motherfucking honey! Yeah, keep it comin'!
[Bee enlarges the party's punch bowl and prompts the others to swim in it, which four partygoers do without hesitation. Loona watches and mouths something]
♫Cotton candy (Ah-ah, ah-ah)♫

♫Brighter than the starlight in the sky!♫
[Beelzebub ends her performance with a firework of confetti and the hellhounds cheer as Loona shakes the cotton candy out of her hair.]
Beelzebub: Awooh, awooh! Vortex! *flies over to Vortex* The party is buzzin' now!
Beelzebub: Fuck! *dusts herself off* I feel like I went a little too hard with the confetti this time though. I have like, *materializes a mini rainbow.* a rainbow... in my vagina right now.
Beelzebub: *notices Loona* Oh, hey! Is this the sweet pup you told me about?
Loona: (offended) Excuse me?
Beelzebub: She's a fuckin' cutie! Where you been hiding girl? *laughs*
Loona: Is there something funny?
Beelzebub: Nah, I'm just really high on all this tasty energy right now. Tex says you don't get invited out much. I hope this itty-bitty get-together can serve as a fun first time.
[Loona briefly looks behind her to see a hellhound slide down a staircase only to get hit in the crotch when he gets down.]
Loona: Mm-hmm.
Beelzebub: I would've thrown a bigger one, but I couldn't convince Belphegor to let me break into her stash of party drugs. So fucking lame! I mean, I usually just steal them, but Belle changed the locks.
Beelzebub: *conjures a bottle of beer* She says I'm a total jackass for trying. But, hey... I'm proud to be a total jackass. *drinks from the bottle*
Vortex: Heh. Anyway, yeah Bee, this is Loona. And, Loona, this is my girlfriend, Bee.
Beelzebub: Nice to meetcha, bitch!
Loona: Oh, this is... she's hot! *widens eyes in realization*
Beelzebub: Ha! Holy shit! Okay. Tex you didn't tell me she was hilarious. That's so funny.
Loona: Right.
Beelzebub: I love that that's the first thing you say to me. You don't give a shit how freaky you come off, and that's. Fucking. Beautiful. *moves next to Loona* You are my new favorite person.
Loona: *fake smiling* Am I, though?
Beelzebub: Yeah, bitch! *laughs* No, really. Reminds me of the time I saw Satan without a shirt on.
[Vortex turns his head towards her at this.]
Beelzebub: I was like, "Oof! Boy! You are hot as hell!".
Beelzebub: But, then I wanted to die, 'cause it was so awkward. 'Cause he's more like a brother to me. You know? But not actually my brother. So, I guess... it was fine. I could hit that...
[Loona looks around awkwardly.]
Beelzebub: Anyway, girl, you have a good time tonight. Get some sweets, get some eats. Drink it, tear it, fuck it up! Whoo!
[Bee walks over to some party guests.]
Beelzebub: Cheers, honey! Thank you for coming.
Beelzebub: Do you need anything? Are you having fun? Are you good? Are you drunk?
[A hellhound with a cone full of Beelzejuice nods in response.]
Beelzebub: Okay, good. Okay, great... *walks off*
Loona: Yeeeah, I'm gonna go.
Vortex: Uh, what? Why? You just got here. At least one drink, right?
Loona: Nope, you really wouldn't like me after one drink.
[She puts her cup down at a nearby staircase and walks out the door, shedding tears as she calls Blitzo.]
[Meanwhile, Blitzo, still in the aftermath of his night out with Stolas, hears his phone ring, then he looks at it and his eyes bug out.]
[Back at the party, Loona is waiting for Blitzo.]
Loona: *sighs* So stupid. I shouldn't have come.
[The I.M.P van arrives as Blitzo rolls down the window.]
Blitzo: Hey Loonie. How you doin', you alright?
Loona: *gets in the van* Yeah I'm fine. I just wanna go.
Imp: He-hey, that sounds like Blitzo!
Blitzo: The o is silent, asshole!
Imp: He-hey, I knew it was you! Fuck, man, where you been? You here for the party?
Blitzo: N-no, I'm just here picking up my daughter.
Imp: Oh, shit! Do you have a daughter now?
Loona: (annoyed) Adopted!
Imp: Oh, man, you're already leaving? Things just got started. Come in and show us all up again.
Blitzo: No, no, thank you. But I think Loonie wants to head back.
[Loona notices a handsome hellhound approaching the van.]
Hellhound: Huh, the hottie next to you wants to leave?
Blitzo: *growls* Watch it!
Loona: *tail wagging* I mean, we could stay a little longer.
Blitzo: I think we need to go, m'kay? I think it's been a long night.
Loona: Well, these people seem to know you. Come on! I think I wanna give this another try. *makes puppy dog eyes.* Pleeease?
Blitzo: *rubs his temples* Okay, fine. Maybe one drink.
[Cut to Blitzo drinking from a keg as the other guests chant.]
Loona: Blitzo! Blitzo! Blitzo! Blitzo!
Blitzo: *hops off the empty keg* Aaagh!
[The hellhounds howl, even Loona.]
Blitzo: Ha ha! That was nothing bitch! Give me a real challenge!
[Beelzebub then appears behind Blitzo holding a chicken leg.]
Beelzebub: Oh, yeah? Wanna fucks with the big bitch, imp boy? I got a challenge for ya.
Vikki: Oh... He's gonna die.
Vortex: *arrives with two yellow kegs* Aaaalright, let's do this! *puts the kegs down* From Bee's personal supply, the hardest shit there is.
[Blitzo does some stretches.]
Vortex: You ready, my man?
Blitzo: Oh, born ready! *tries to open one of the kegs* Bring it, barky! I will drink you under this fucking table, you have no idea what kind of night I've had!
[Beelzebub uses her powers to lift the kegs and prep nozzles for them.]
Beelzebub: *laughs* Alright, shit talker, but there hasn't been a soul yet who can beat me at my own game. So, you better bring the fire, baby.
Blitzo: Oh, is Queen Bee too scared to lose to a little imp like me?
Beelzebub: Oh, okay. Let's get it on, you little bastard!
[Vortex signals for the contest to begin, and Beelzebub and Blitzo start drinking.]
Loona: Come on, Blitz! Fuck her up! You can do it!
[Blitzo rips off the nozzle and chugs the whole keg, surprising Beelzebub, who looks at him in concern.]
Blitzo: *climbs on top of the empty keg* Who's the queen now?!
Loona: Yeah! That's my DAD!
Beelzebub: Well fuck me! That's a first. I haven't had a first in a while. That was magical, seriously, impressive. I tip my crown to you, imp boy. *bows before Blitzo* Respect.
[She howls, prompting the other party guests, including Loona, to cheer as Blitzo passes out drunk, as he gets carried off as Beelzebub and Vortex look at each other in concern.]
[As the party continues, the guests continue having fun and chatting, Loona is shown laughing with a couple of other hellhounds, and Vortex taps her on the shoulder.]
Vortex: Hey, Loon. I don't mean to be a buzz kill here. But your uh, dad... guy dude... Is um... He's seeming a bit...
[Beelzebub then comes up behind him looking concerned.]
Beelzebub: Out of control, like... A mess.
Vortex: Yeah, it's worrisome. You wanna maybe check on him or something?
Loona: What!? No! No, Blitzo is fine. He's always a mess, trust me.
Beelzebub: Look honey, I see people having fun and getting fucked up all the time. But, he's clearly getting wasted off his ass and causing problems on purpose. So, I feel like, you should check up on him at least.
[Loona starts to get angry as the hounds she was talking to poke their heads over to eavesdrop.]
Beelzebub: Just see if something's up.
[Loona then marches over to Beelzebub and confronts her.]
Loona: Don't act like you know him like I do.
Beelzebub: I ain't sayin' that. I'm just pretty sure he's had like four tongues inside him at once. I mean... good for him.
[Vortex nods in agreement.]
Beelzebub: But... I can taste the flavor of people at my parties, and he's giving off a very... not okay vibe, you know?
[Loona gets progressively angrier.]
Loona: Oh yeah, and I'd bet you'd know the okay vibe, right? I mean everyone likes you so much.
[Beelzebub flies up near Loona's face to challenge her.]
Beelzebub: What's that supposed to mean, you got a problem or somethin' sour cream? *shifts into her larger demonic form* Don't fuck with me!
[Loona preps for a fight until she sees how it's upsetting Vortex.]
Loona: *sighs* Sorry. Yeah, nope, I'll, uh... I'll check on him.
[She walks off as Beelzebub shows what appears to be genuine concern, possibly for Loona before she shrinks back to her normal size.]
Beelzebub: Uuuugh... sorry, sorry. I know I got a little spicy there. I just... hope everything works out. Now, let's dance! *flies off with Vortex*
[Meanwhile, Loona looks around trying to find Blitzo.]
Loona: Blitz! Bliitz! Where are you, shithead! BLIT-
[She sees Blitzo French-kissing another imp.]
Loona: Oh piss on a dick! *grabs Blitzo by the collar* What the fuck are you doing Blitz?!
Blitzo: This guy~ *points to the imp, who briefly waves*
Loona: It looks like you're in the middle of a goddamn orgy! Stop!
Blitzo: (slurred) Look, I didn't expect you to come in here and see any of this, Loonie. I'm so sorry, but it's a party, I'm just havin' fun with, uh... *turns to the imp* The fuck is your name again?
Imp: Dennis.
Blitzo: Christ on a stick, you would be a Dennis. *waves arms, shooing Dennis away* Get the fuck away from me! I'm not fucking a Dennis tonight! I need a Monica or Alejandro in here, stat!
[The imp standing by a nearby corner pulls him in.]
Blitzo: *sticks tongue out* Better~
[Loona punches the imp's face in, causing him to back away, then Blitzo stumbles, and Loona catches him.]
Loona: You don't need anyone else sucking your face, freaky weirdo. *carries Blitzo over her shoulder* You need to drink something other than Beelzejuice.
Blitzo: Uuuugh, no...
[Loona carries Blitzo to the van, and buckles him up, then her three new friends wave her goodbye; Loona waves back, then she gets in the van and drives off.]
Loona: Do you need to throw up?
Blitzo: (pouty) Mmm... no...
Loona: *scoffs* Yeah you do.
[Back at the apartment, Loona turns on the lights and puts Blitzo back on the couch, then gets a glass of water and a blanket for him.]
Blitzo: I had a really shitty day...
Loona: Oh yeah? Is that why you drank like five gallons worth of who-knows-what?
Blitzo: Fuck, Fizz was right. I'm gonna die alone, aren't I? Just a wrinkly, old, withered, waste. Will you be there, Loonie?
Loona: Be...where?
Blitzo: I dunno, jus- *mumbles* ...lonely... Die alone...
Loona: I'll be there, Dad.
[She drapes the blanket over Blitzo and pats his head.]
Loona: Now go the fuck to sleep... okay? *turns off the lights*
Blitzo: *mumbling* Millie... Moxxie... Stolas...
[Loona takes one last look at Blitzo before heading into her room, then after a beat, Blitzo vomits up the Beelzejuice.]
Blitzo: Fuck! Yeah, I did need to throw up.
