Here is a sample script I made for shits and giggles.

Blitzo: Alright gang! Let's get straight to business! Mox, you got the ammo?

Moxxie: Yessir... they're in the back.

Blitzo: What do you mean in the back?

Moxxie: Yeah.... the back... just like you told me, right?

Blitzo: ...when the FUCK DID I SAY PUT THEM IN THE BACK MOXXIE?!

Moxxie: Oh... I uh.... must have not heard you right.... sorry...

Blitzo: Do you know how many times I've told you to do something right the first time and you will always FUCK UP?

Moxxie: No I don't...

Blitzo: Fuckity Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck FUCK!

Moxxie: ...Fuck...
